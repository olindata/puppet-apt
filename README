puppet-apt

This is the puppet-apt module.

* Apt module quickly imported from Marco Bonetti's work
* Adapted by Walter Heck <walter@tribily.com> in 2011-09 for Tribily
* Adapted by Walter Heck <walter@openquery.com> in 2011-11 for Open Query
* Added apt::source compatibilty defination for Puppetlab's apt::source
  defination by Daniel Black <daniel.black> in 2013-08 for Open Query

This module allows you to easily manage your apt repositories

To use this module, add this module  to your puppet repository and add 
"include apt" to all your nodes. That should do the trick!

There are a couple of defines for well known apt repositories:

* dotdeb.org
* backports for debian lenny and squeeze and ubuntu hardy and lucid
* mariadb.org
* ourdelta.org
* percona
* puppetlabs
* rabbitMQ
* Tribily.com server monitoring
* hwraid.le-vert.net
* always looking for more!

As a number of other puppet modules use Puppetlabs apt module this provides
an apt::source defination with the same inteface (with a few features missing).

Feedback is more then welcome!
